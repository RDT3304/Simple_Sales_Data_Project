# Simple_Sales_Data_Project

This project was made as practice for identify lagging geographic areas of sales. This also allowed me to practice drilling down to see what categories, sub categories and products were most popular and least popular. This also helped in forming ideas of possible marketing campaigns and cross promotional opportunities to help drive sales in a given market.

Initial commit including original data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/superstore-sales), code used to explore data, images saved, finished mock power point and pdf for relevant stakeholders and marketing teams with suggestions of mock marketing campaigns.
